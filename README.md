# Quick Start

This package orchestrate cMD metadata curation processes, including 
initiation, status check, and deploy. To contribute a new data to cMD,
(Note: For cMD curation team, ODM should handle steps 3 and 4.)

1. Look at the [template][] and [already curated studies][] to see what curated files should look like.
2. To add a new study, open an issue using the template _**'curatedMetagenomicData study curation by DOI'**_. 
This will create two curation template files in a directory under `inst/curated`.
  + the name of the dedicated directory for your study is `{last name of the first author}{initial of the first authorâ€™s first name}_{year published}` (e.g., 'AsnicarF_2017')
  + two files in this directories are `{dir_name}_study.tsv` and `{dir_name}_sample.tsv` 
  (e.g., 'AsnicarF_2017_study.tsv' and 'AsnicarF_2017_sample.tsv')

3. Starting from these templates, please curate your metadata. Commit and 
create a pull request. Or if you don't like git, use Github.com's 
["Upload Files" button](https://github.com/waldronlab/curatedMetagenomicDataCuration/tree/master/inst/curated) 
to upload to create a pull request without the need to use git.

4. Add a 'ready to review' label if your metadata is ready for the team's final 
review. cMD curation team will review/validate your metadata. If it passes, it 
will be added into cMD package. Any validation fails will be reported back to
you for your revision/update.
